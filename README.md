How to host our application on your device:

For our hosting we used XAMMP, so this guide will be skewed to if you are using XAMMP but will work regardless as long as the file structure is correct.

Step 1: the api.php, config.php and the env file containing sensititive information (not provided because to prevent sensititve information from being public) should be in the root directory folder where you are trying to host the application

Step 2: the zip file provided contains a php, js, img and css folder regarding each category these folders should be placed inside the root directory too, do not remove the files from the respective folder.

Step 3: After you are sure the file structure is correct you may use terminal commands or a localhost url to view the website. It will be full functional and styled accordingly if the file structure is correct.

Note: we used XAMMP so we opened the application which opens a localhost url in the web browser, from there you can go to the respective page through the url. All buttons/links in the website are functional and will redirect accordingly. For example, my localhost url could be http://localhost/php/home.php, this will show the home page and the application can be navigated with no issues. A port might be provided like 3000 on XAMMP but everything will still work regardless.
